# Discord Bot
This is a open source Discord bot I created.

Feel free to use the code as an example for how to initiate the bot, create cogs, and load your cogs into the main file.

Current features include: wikipedia page lookup, youtube video search, and a dictionary.
Access the commands through Discord by using the "!" command tag (example: !wiki pyramids)
