# Discord Bot
This is a open source Discord bot I created.

Feel free to use the code as an example for how to initiate the bot, create cogs, and load your cogs into the main file.

Discord.py API reference: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

Current features include: wikipedia page lookup, youtube video search, dictionary, and a reddit scraper.
Access the commands through Discord by using the "!" command tag (example: !wiki pyramids)

This repository will be updated as I create more cogs/commands for the bot. Each command will have explicit comments explaining how each operation is ran.
